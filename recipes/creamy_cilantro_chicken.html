    <strong>Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, ssliced</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Directions</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat chicken breasts dry and sprinkle with 1/2 the Cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the very hot oil and cook, turning occasionally, until juices run clear when chicken is pricked with a fork and both sides are browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside, reserving drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add green onions and bell pepper to the drippings in the skillet. Cook until tender, about 1 minute. Add chicken broth and wine and bring to a boil, about 5 minutes. Simmer until juices have reduced to about 3/4 cup, about 5 minutes more. Add cream and continue to simmer to reduce slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cilantro, plus remaining Cajun seasoning. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the skillet, cover, and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
